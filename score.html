					<hr>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="lucas">I rate the music in Interstellar 5/5. In my opinion, in a movie, the score should give some information to the listener, not just fill sonic space. In Interstellar, music or the lack of it feels very intentional. For example, when Matthew McConaughey arrives on the water planet, he yells at the other crew members to get going, because every hour on the planet is seven years on Earth. As soon as he mentions the stakes, the score for the scene, “Mountains”, begins. It starts with a rhythmic clicking sound, where each click is representative of one day passing on Earth, helping the listener consciously or unconsciously get a sense of how time is passing. Although the music shares a lot of similarities between specific tracks, as a listener, I still felt like it gave me an idea of what was upcoming and allowed me to temper my expectations for the upcoming scene. Even if the same motif was repeated across tracks, there would be variations upon it to express the emotion of the scene better, whether it was in expanding the orchestration to give it a much grander feel, or changing the rhythmic pattern to show the flow of time. In scoring the movie, Zimmer also used silence very intentionally. Several times throughout the movie, such as when McConaughey is weathering the black hole, the score cuts to silence so the viewer can only focus on McConaughey’s battle against the environment. Overall, when I listened to the score, I felt that Zimmer’s choices always reflected intention in conveying an aspect of the movie to the viewer.

					<hr>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="peter">The score of Interstellar is truly phenomenal (5/5); the repeated themes tie the whole movie together, and the music effectively creates suspense and amplifies the emotions of the scenes.</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="peter">For the soundtrack, Hans Zimmer chose to use an organ for the melody and much of the accompaniment. Not only does this create an almost haunting melody that hints at sadness and regret, but the choice of an organ also creates an atmosphere of awe that aptly reflects the seemingly impossible mission ahead of the intrepid astronomers. In addition, the variations on the themes capture the emotions at different moments in the film. In “Cornfield Chase,” the organ is accompanied by bells, lending the piece a more upbeat and energetic feel that fits with the scene (chasing a drone through farmland). On the other hand, in “No Time for Caution,” the organ is joined by various string instruments that lend depth to the piece. In addition, the piece has abrupt accents and darker undertones that lend the piece a more aggressive feel, highlighting the tension and suspense present in the scene (a risky docking procedure). 
					</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="peter">To use the music to the full extent, the movie also creates several moments of silence that are more powerful than any music could be. On the water planet, a ticking sound can be heard, which in fact shows the passage of time (each tick is a day passing on Earth) and serves to build tension, and after the failed docking procedure, the explosion occurs mostly in silence.</p>
