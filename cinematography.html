					<hr>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="lucas">I rate the cinematography in Interstellar a 5/5. I think that good cinematography is visually appealing but also tells a story. In Interstellar, the cinematography feels intentional and usually serves one of two roles: to show emotion, or to make the viewer decide it themself. Hoyte van Hoytema, Interstellar’s cinematographer, frequently used the contrast between man and nature to do so. Often when characters are exploring new environments, such as when Anne Hathaway as Brand and Wes Bentley as Doyle step out on the water planet, they are introduced with a cowboy shot to emphasize the adventurous nature of their undertaking. However, the camera work is otherwise primarily face shots and medium shots. Interestingly, the camera often uses dirty, shaky shots. The shaky shots give the viewer the feeling of being there themselves, since the unsteady nature of the camera work mirrors the perspective one might find themself in under such tumultuous conditions. The dirty shots serve the same purpose. For example, when there is an over-the-shoulder shot (such as when McConaughey as Cooper looks out the ship), the viewer can imagine they are there. The cinematography also frequently highlights the environment with the use of many establishing shots as the crew encounters new territory. Additionally, a repeated camera shot is one on the side of the ship, showing none of the crew but rather the ship’s outside conditions and the nearby terrain. When face shots or medium shots are used, the viewer is shown the emotions the crew themselves feel, but when dirty over-the-shoulder shots, establishing shots, or shots of the outside of the ship are used, the viewer imagines what the crew must feel in such a grand adventure.</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="lucas">I loved the cinematography. It was beautiful and felt very seamless, and I thought there was a good mix of explicit emotion demonstrated and opportunities to form my own opinion before I was reminded how the crew actually felt. Everything felt very intentional and worked well.</p>

					<hr>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="peter">The cinematography of Interstellar is overall very strong (4.5/5), with a variety of shots that work together to add emotion and depth to scenes. 					</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="peter">Interstellar uses establishing shots very well to create a sense of scale that in turn instills a sense of awe. For example, shots of the black hole Gargantua and of the frozen landscape of Dr. Mann’s planet help to show how the humans exploring those places are insignificant compared to the enormous backdrop of space. In addition, during the scene on the water planet, the directors use shots from above to make the astronauts seem small and powerless. Despite their knowledge and experience, they are mostly helpless when confronted with the dangers of an alien planet. In addition, during times of pressure, the movie has shaky shots that transport the viewer to the same place as the characters. When escaping the giant tidal wave, the inside shots of the cabin are extremely unstable, not only mimicking the situation the characters were in, but also mirroring their inner emotions. Finally, during times of emotion, the cinematographers aptly use headshots to focus the watcher solely on the facial expressions of the characters. This helps the viewer connect with the characters, and experience what they do as well (ex: when Cooper watches the messages from his son that were sent over a 23 years span). 
					</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="peter">Of course, at the end, I wanted to give a quick nod to the physics team that oversaw the creation of the movie. Looking at the shots of Gargantua, for example, the CGI not only creates a phenomenal scene, but it is also somewhat consistent with physics models. Not only do we see accreting material around the black hole, but we also see evidence of gravitational lensing (bending of light due to gravity). I think it's really nice how the scenes in the movie are not only really cool, but also are reasonable (from a scientific perspective).
