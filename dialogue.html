					<hr>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="lucas">I rate the dialogue in Interstellar a 4.2/5. I think that dialogue should feel natural considering the circumstances the actor is in while simultaneously conveying information to the viewer, whether it is information about the world the characters inhabit or just their inner emotion. Because Interstellar is set in a world pretty removed from ours, I was expecting there to be a fair bit of awkward dialogue which felt like it was only serving as exposition without feeling natural for the characters. To my pleasant surprise, I only really felt like there was one section that the dialogue didn’t feel good to me. In most scenes, like when Matthew McConaughey is landing the ship on the water planet, his dialogue tells the listener a lot of information (a reminder of the stakes, and the emotions Cooper feels knowing his daughter is growing without him as time passes), while also interacting very naturally with the environment. In another scene, as McConaughey detaches from the ship, his final words with Anne Hathaway as Brand feel very natural too and the both of them interact with their environment even as they do so as they struggle against g-forces. However, the scene I found jarring was when Cooper is within the black hole. McConaughey as Cooper is in the black hole with TARS (as voiced by Bill Irwin), and he comes to the conclusion that there is no distinction between the five-dimensional beings that helped him and humans as they currently are. Instead, humans will at some point develop to the point that they have the capability to help him save themselves. However, the reasoning he uses to arrive at this conclusion feels rather tenuous, and the way he delivers it feels belabored to me. When I listened to this scene the first time, I felt a little insulted, because it felt like Jonathan and Christopher Nolan thought I was an idiot that had to have everything spoon-fed to me when they were writing the script. The dialogue just feels uncomfortable and unnatural as characters inside a self-contained world. It feels like McConaughey and Irwin are talking to me, not Cooper and TARS to each other. In general, however, the dialogue flowed and I felt like I understood more about the world in a natural way as I listened.</p>

					<hr>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="peter">The dialogue present in Interstellar is not anything particularly outstanding, but it is solid overall (4/5) as the film has to simultaneously flow naturally and help the watcher along.</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="peter">One unfortunate result of the heavy scientific nature of the film is the necessity of explaining some physics to the watcher. For example, in order to explain the theory that wormholes form by bending spacetime, one astronaut has to explain to his comrades how it works. This makes certain sections are mildly clunky, as it doesn’t make sense that the other astronauts would not have a prerequisite understanding before being sent on the highly important mission. Similarly, the astronauts explain to each other how strong gravitational fields cause time to pass more slowly. In a way, this feels almost condescending to the watcher, though perhaps this is due to my interest in astronomy (and thus my already present knowledge). Beyond this, the dialogue is occasionally too soft compared to the music, and while the soundtrack behind Interstellar is a masterpiece, it would be great if we could understand the characters without subtitles (especially as Matthew McConaughey tends to mumble). However, as a whole, the movie does well in this department. The dialogue tends to be fluid and makes sense in each scene, and while the scientific explanations do make some scenes slow, they certainly aid the watcher in understanding the movie.</p>
