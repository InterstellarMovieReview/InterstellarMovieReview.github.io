					<hr>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="peter">The acting throughout Interstellar is great (4.5/5), with Matthew McConaughey doing a great job as Cooper, and Anne Hathaway doing a good job with Brand. The characters show a lot of emotion (that feels genuine), and their interactions feel natural. 
					</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="peter">From the start of the film, McConaughey manages to portray Cooper brilliantly. While I do complain that Cooper is hard to hear sometimes, the mumbling/drawling does fit his character and occupation. In addition, Cooper’s interactions with Murph feel like a genuine father-daughter relationship, and pave the way for the later parts of the film. 
					</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify;" id="peter">In fact, perhaps the best piece of acting in the film is when Cooper watches the messages from his son and Murph that were sent over a 23 year span. According to McConaughey, the scene in the movie was actually the first take (and his first time viewing the messages), as he wanted his reaction to be as genuine as possible. Clearly, this worked, as the scene is full of emotion, with headshots aptly displaying Cooper’s regret over leaving, and his grief that he cannot truly watch his kids grow up.
